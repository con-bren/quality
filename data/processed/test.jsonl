In the course of Darger's story--titled The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnean War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion --the sisters (the Vivian Girls) manage to escape from the men (the Glandelinians) time and time again, but countless less fortunate girl-slaves are spectacularly mutilated and slaughtered along the way. Darger is what is known as an \"outsider\" artist--which is to say that he didn't receive any formal art training; was not, during his lifetime, part of the art world; and was exposed very little, if at all, to traditional art in general. (Presumably in anticipation of a fainter-hearted audience, the gorier pictures were excluded from last year's Darger exhibition at the University of Iowa, of which this show is an expanded version.) It's ironic, too, that critics such as MacGregor persist in seeing Darger as an unself-conscious obsessive, unable to separate his life from his created fantasy world, since in fact Darger's work is full of precisely the sort of self-referentiality that in a contemporary insider artist would be read as a rather ordinary example of postmodern detachment.", "query": " Which of the following is NOT true of Darger as an artist?", "option_0": " He probably had more time to focus as an artist because he pretty much always lived by himself", "option_1": " Before he was discovered he consistently held a different job to support himself", "option_2": " His work is good enough to sell for a decent amount of money", "option_3": " He was trained by some of the best in his fields (collage-work and cartoon-based art training)", "label": "NA"}

With slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the hanging arms of its side, of its right side, and extended it toward Steffens, a graciously offered hand. Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized right away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the robot's formality not to ask him why. Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear plastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while Ball and the second robot looked on in silence. Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot was referring. During that time, Steffens was usually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon team roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the strangest culture in history. And one morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover that hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively decontaminated the entire area.

The Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The building of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. Theoretically, all he was supposed to do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking for the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of human colonization. But he knew very clearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this robot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the other, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty. And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him, that the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and gone. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an outpost? And then the robots sent a picture .

And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him, that the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and gone. \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now Steffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone.

Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear plastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes.

Since each of the robots was immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens guessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake, because they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met by the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side, humbly requesting to be of service. There was still the mystery of those buildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have to be cleared up before they could leave. Something he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as unusual to the robots as they were to him. It had taken them some time to recognize that the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and it was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were needed.

The pundits' verdict is in: The war is \"doomed\" and \"already lost.\" Of course, the best way to assure that Milosevic doesn't break, that NATO comes apart, and that the United States loses the war is to predict that Milosevic won't break, that NATO will come apart, and that the United States will lose the war.", "query": " Who is the key factor in determining the ethics surrounding the war?", "option_0": " The media", "option_1": " The Pope", "option_2": " The President", "option_3": " NATO", "label": "NA"}

So the media's consensus about Kosovo is that NATO's policy is \"not working.\" The alternative perspective goes overlooked: that the question is what NATO must do, that atrocities are a challenge rather than a verdict, and that NATO should persevere precisely because they continue. \"The idea that Italy and Greece object to ground troops and therefore we shouldn't do what is necessary to win this war, is, in my view, ridiculous,\" protested Bill Kristol on This Week . Otherwise, the United States would have to police the world alone, which is unsustainable politically (thanks in part to vociferous opposition from many of these same critics), not to mention militarily. This dichotomy rules out the fallback strategy that NATO and U.S. officials have articulated from the outset: to make the cost of Milosevic's \"victory\" outweigh the rewards.

Take Albania, which averaged 8.4 percent growth during this period--and attribute much (perhaps all) of its measured growth to a massive Ponzi scheme, which collapsed this winter, bringing down the entire Albanian economy. (This summer Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will probably be invited to join the alliance.) Amid much protest from the right wing, Kwasniewski's government restored the legal rights to abortion and divorce removed by the Walesa government. Slovakia has had less success than other Central European countries at ousting corrupt Communist bosses from its bureaucracy. Between 50 percent and 90 percent of the country invested nearly $3 billion in a Ponzi scheme that collapsed this winter. Shortages and slipping wages sparked street protests this winter that forced the ruling socialists to hand power over to a caretaker government. Though Macedonia avoided the Balkan War, ethnic tensions and instability are a problem. Last year, the country's liberal, pro-West president was seriously injured in a car-bomb attack. A Greek minority demands that Macedonia, with its ethnically Albanian majority, be absorbed into Greece. The government battles rebels from Abkhazia, a Muslim province in the country's northwest.

But look closely at what Ebert says: To be reminded of the power of film as a medium is not quite the same as being moved by a particular film, and Bringing Out the Dead is, for all its hectic pacing and breakneck intensity, an oddly unmoving experience.

In place of Sport, Harvey Keitel's suave, vicious pimp in the earlier film, Bringing Out the Dead features Cy, a suave, vicious drug dealer played by Cliff Curtis. Nicolas Cage's Frank Pierce saves Cy from a death as gruesome as the one De Niro's Travis Bickle visited on Sport, and when Frank does take a life (in the movie's best, most understated scene), it's an act of mercy.

It had the town's only (broken) escalator, which took you deep into a dark underworld where the smell of diesel bus fumes and chip fat was intoxicating; and a big National Express sign announced 'Book here for Scotland'. \"But for the first wave of new towns, the execution was flawed.", "query": " Which was *not* considered a flaw of New Towns?", "option_0": " Working class people had no say in the designs", "option_1": " Neglect and lack of attention over time", "option_2": " Government policies", "option_3": " Lack of transportation for jobs", "label": "NA"}

New Towns were sometimes sublime and surely strange; but more of a success than the popular consensus gave them credit for. Perhaps now we're truly recognising some of that value because, as archetypal New Towns like Milton Keynes and Harlow celebrate milestone birthdays this year (fiftieth and seventieth respectively), the UK government has floated a new generation of New Towns that could once again change the face of Britain. Most cities are ultimately exercises in speculative pissing in the wind: developers develop, architects design, but none of it is woven together and thought through from scratch. Today Bournville feels quaint, especially if you compare it to the later, more radical New Town of Redditch, a mere six stops down the Midlands' Cross-City Line. The New Towns of this era sat alongside the radical municipal socialism exemplified by existing cities like Sheffield, London and Newcastle, which built swathes of housing and other civic amenities in the electric post-war period of progress. \"That's unusually urban and intimidating; in general there is a calm softness to our New Town design.\" It could all have been more dramatic: Geoffrey Jellicoe's Motopia in Slough envisaged a city with roads on the roof, while unbuilt proposals for Hook in Hampshire look like a jet-propelled version of quasi-New Town Thamesmead.", "query": " Which foreign city is a good example of modern New Town design?", "option_0": " Canberra", "option_1": " Mohenjo-daro", "option_2": " Palmanova", "option_3": " Alexandria", "label": "NA"}

In the public consciousness, everything from the edge estate to the expanded town to the full New Town has become conflated: we see council houses surrounded by trees and are not always sure if it's an estate or a New Town.

Dr Beckie Port, senior research communications officer at Parkinson's UK, says, \"The more people you put in your experiments, the more you can iron out some of the complexities and start to see trends, It's going to be a mammoth mission to start teasing out individual factors that could be used for personalised medicine, but it's not impossible.\" The project anticipates a 25 per cent diagnostic rate in rare diseases but Fowler says the remaining 75 per cent don't just get put aside, the data goes into research environments where it will be worked on: \"It's the start, not the end, of the journey.\" It is estimated that around 5 per cent of Parkinson's cases have a genetic link; but Dr Port thinks the role of genetics in the disease is probably a lot larger.", "query": " The article did not address the role of ______ in genetic testing.", "option_0": " cost", "option_1": " patient benefits", "option_2": " privacy concerns", "option_3": " research", "label": "NA"}

In the public consciousness, everything from the edge estate to the expanded town to the full New Town has become conflated: we see council houses surrounded by trees and are not always sure if it's an estate or a New Town. In John Grindrod's groundbreaking (pardon the pun) book Concretopia, he says New Towns \"sit alongside the creation of the welfare state, the NHS and the post-war revolution in education as monuments to a nation's desire to move on, not just from the destruction of the war years, but from the inequalities and squalor inherited from the Industrial Revolution.\" This is the very essence of town planning: that creating something new, something that works better than what went before, can mould superior worlds.

With Bournville and the garden cities we see a key touchstone that would also be echoed in the later New Towns project: the idea that the city was broken and escape was the answer.

{"context": "Open Access: Motivation 2.1 OA as Solving Problems There are lamentably many problems for which OA is part of the solution. We are in the midst of a pricing crisis for scholarly journals. Before the rise of OA, all peer-reviewed journals were toll access, and even today about three-quarters of peer-reviewed journals are toll access. When the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted unanimously for a strong OA policy in February 2008, Professor Stuart Shieber explained that cumulative price increases had forced the Harvard library to undertake \u201cserious cancellation efforts\u201d for budgetary reasons. The largest publishers minimize cancellations by bundling hundreds or thousands of high-demand and low-demand journals into \u201cbig deals,\u201d which reduce the bargaining power of libraries and the cost-cutting options available to them.

Now that the internet is at our fingertips, OA is within the reach of researchers and research institutions acting alone and needn\u2019t wait for publishers, legislation, or markets.
